              Head,Body and Footer in html5
Footer:
   The HTML5 <footer> tag is used for defining the footer of an HTML document or section.Footers usually
contain information such as the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use,
privacy policy, etc.
   Contact information within a <footer> tag should be marked up using the <address> tag.Although footers are
typically located at the bottom of a document, this is not required (although it cannot be placed within a <header> or
another <footer> element, and it cannot contain a <header> element).A document/section can have more than one footer.
The <footer> tag was introduced in HTML 5.

    Head:
     The HTML <head> tag is used for indicating the head section of the HTML document.

The head can contain other HTML tags that provide information about the document such as title, 
description, keywords etc. You will often see the <title> tag, <meta> tag, the <script> tag, and the <style> tag 
in the head of a typical HTML document.

Most of this information is not displayed in the browser (although the title usually appears in the browser's title bar)
but can be useful for the functionality of the page. The head tag is placed between the opening and closing
 <html> </html> tags. 

 Body:
   The HTML <body> tag is used for indicating the main content section of the HTML document. 
The body tag is placed between the </head> and the </html> tags.

Note that the attributes for the body tag are no longer supported in HTML (these were previously 
specified as deprecated in HTML 4.01). You should now use CSS for defining the presentation of 
your document body. For example, see CSS background-color and CSS text-decoration.
